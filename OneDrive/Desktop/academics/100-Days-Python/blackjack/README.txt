This Python script simulates a simplified version of the classic card game, Blackjack. It allows a single user to play against a dealer, following the basic rules of the game.

Key Features:

Card Dealing: Uses a dictionary to represent a standard 52-card deck (values assigned to face cards). Random card selection is implemented using the random module.
Hand Value Calculation: Accurately calculates the value of a hand, including the special rule for Aces (which can be 1 or 11).
User Interaction: Prompts the user to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (end their turn).
Dealer Logic: Implements the standard dealer logic: the dealer hits until their hand value is 17 or higher.
Win/Loss Determination: Correctly determines the winner based on Blackjack rules (Blackjack, bust, higher hand value).
Clear Output: Provides clear output to the user, displaying the cards dealt and the final results.

How to Use:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed.
Run the blackjack.py script.
Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.

Game Logic:

The user and dealer are each dealt two cards.
The user can choose to "hit" or "stand."
If the user's hand exceeds 21 ("bust"), they lose.
The dealer then plays, hitting until their hand is 17 or higher.
The winner is determined based on Blackjack rules.
A blackjack condition is also handled.

Potential Enhancements (Future Development):

Implement betting.
Add support for multiple players.
Implement splitting and doubling down.
Improve the user interface.
Add graphical output.
Implement a more robust card deck, that removes cards that have already been drawn.
